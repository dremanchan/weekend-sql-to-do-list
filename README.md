## Description

    This goal of this project was to create a to-do list that would allow the user to create tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them.

    The technologies used were HTML, CSS, javascript, postgresql, and jquery.

    The new technique learned during this project was changing data on a server and database with a PUT and DELETE ajax command.

    I spent 12 hours on this project.
